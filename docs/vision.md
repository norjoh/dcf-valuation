# Project Vision — DCF & Valuation Assistant

## Purpose
This project aims to build a transparent, cautious, and educational valuation assistant that helps users create high-quality DCF and comparable company analyses.

The tool is designed to:
- Support student analysts and early-career finance professionals
- Improve consistency and discipline in valuation work
- Serve as a personal learning platform for advanced valuation, risk, and macro analysis
- Demonstrate responsible and traceable use of AI in financial modeling

## Core Goals
- Generate a full DCF model from:
  - Historical financial data
  - Explicit, inspectable assumptions
  - Management outlooks (when available)
- Generate a comparable companies (comps) analysis
- Provide:
  - Sensitivity analysis
  - Risk warnings
  - Data quality diagnostics
- Export results to:
  - Excel (fully formula-based)
  - PowerPoint (professional valuation deck)

## Design Philosophy
- No silent fallbacks
- No black-box assumptions
- Every number must be traceable to:
  - A data source
  - A transformation rule
  - Or an explicit user/engine assumption

## Initial Scope (v1)
- Non-financial companies only
- Single-segment companies
- Equity valuation via FCFF DCF
- Manual peer group selection for comps
- Desktop / local-first execution

## Long-Term Vision
- Multi-segment (SOTP) valuations
- Industry-specific models
- Macro-driven valuation scenarios
- Qualitative research automation
- Full web-based UI
- AI-assisted explanations and report drafting
